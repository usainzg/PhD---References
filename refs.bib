abstract = {This paper proposes techniques for data allocation and computation mapping when compiling affine loop nest sequences for distributed-memory clusters.Techniques for transformation and detection of parallelism, and generation of communication sets relying on the polyhedral framework already exist. However, these recent approaches used a simple strategy to map computation to nodes -- typically block or block-cyclic. These mappings may lead to excess communication volume for multiple loop nests. In addition, the data allocation strategy used did not permit efficient weak scaling. We address these complementary problems by proposing automatic techniques to determine computation placements for identified parallelism and allocation of data. Our approach for data allocation is driven by tiling of data spaces along with a scheme to allocate and deallocate tiles on demand and reuse them. We show that our approach for computation mapping yields more effective mappings than those that can be developed using vendor-supplied libraries. Experimental results on some sequences of BLAS calls demonstrate a mean speedup of 1.82x over versions written with ScaLAPACK. Besides enabling weak scaling for distributed memory, data tiling also improves locality for shared-memory parallelization. Experimental results on a 32-core shared-memory SMP system shows a mean speedup of 2.67x over code that is not data tiled.},

abstract = {This paper presents several algorithms to solve code generation and optimization problems specific to machines with distributed address spaces. Given a description of how the computation is to be partitioned across the processors in a machine, our algorithms produce an SPMD (single program multiple data) program to be run on each processor. Our compiler generated the necessary receive and send instructions, optimizes the communication by eliminating redundant communication and aggregating small messages into large messages, allocates space locally on each processor, and translates global data addresses to local addresses.Our techniques are based on an exact data-flow analysis on individual array element accesses. Unlike data dependence analysis, this analysis determines if two dynamic instances refer to the same value, and not just to the same location. Using this information, our compiler can handle more flexible data decompositions and find more opportunities for communication optimization than systems based on data dependence analysis.Our technique is based on a uniform framework, where data decompositions, computation decompositions and the data flow information are all represented as systems of linear inequalities. We show that the problems of communication code generation, local memory management, message aggregation and redundant data communication elimination can all be solved by projecting polyhedra represented by sets of inequalities onto lower dimensional spaces.},
